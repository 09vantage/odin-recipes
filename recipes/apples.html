    <h3>The Poison Apples Instructions</h3>
    <p>Great candy apples and great treats - but be careful, they are poisonous! AHAHA</p>

    <h4>Ingredients for the delicious apples</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>6 Fuji apples (or any other type of unwaxed firm apples)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup light corn syrup</li>
            <li> 2 cups sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup water</li>
            <li> Food colouring (your choice of colour! red, black or purple work nicely for poison apples).</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>How to make Snow White's Poison Apples</h4>
    <p> <em>These are going to be so tasty!</em></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and dry your unwaxed apples, making sure they are completely dry because bubbles can form when you coat them in the <em>poison</em> candy if they are still wet.</li>
            <li>Insert the skewers into the apples and set them to the side</li>
            <li>Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper and grease the paper with butter</li>
            <li>In a saucepan, combine the corn syrup, the sugar, the water and the food coloring and, over medium high heat, bring the mixture to a boil, stirring until the sugar dissolves</li>
            <li>Once the sugar is dissolved, lower the heat to medium and let it boil, without stirring, until it reaches hard crack stage. Temperature should read 300/310 degrees on a candy thermometer. Another way of knowing is to drip some of the candy in a cup with cold water. If the candy solidifies, it is ready</li>
            <li>Dip the apples into the candy, swirling them to get rid of any excess, and set them in the prepared baking sheet</li>
            <li>Let them cool for at least 30 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
