# odin-recipes

Welcome to my Odin Recipes README file

This project will be specifically for demonstrating my understanding of HTML. 

I will be creating a webpage with subpages which contains the use of the following HTML elements:

1. Hyperlinks 
2. Tables
3. Strong/em
4. Headers

Throughout the project I will update this README file with general notes and observations.
