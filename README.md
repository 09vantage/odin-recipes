Welcome to my Odin Recipes README file

This project is designed to demonstrate my understanding of HTML. 

## What I plan to demonstrate
I will be creating a website with subpages which contain the use of the following HTML elements:

1. Hyperlinks 
2. Ordered and Unordered lists
3. Strong/em
4. Headers

## How it went
Creating the websites enabled me to practice using certain elements at a basic level. 
It wasn't particularly difficult to manage as the instructions provided by The Odin Project were pretty straight forward. 

## What is coming next?
I am hoping to format my website using CSS by adding colour and formatting the images to fit in a more aesthetically pleasing way.
